# Documentation

For more detailed information and guidelines on using Solid Lints, please refer to the documentation: 
* https://lints.solid.software

# Usage

Add dependency in your pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  solid_lints: <INSERT LATEST VERSION>
```

And then include `solid_lints` into your project top-level `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
include: package:solid_lints/analysis_options.yaml
```

Also you can use a specialized rule set designed for Dart tests.
Add an `analysis_options.yaml` file under the `test/` directory, and include the ruleset:

```yaml
include: package:solid_lints/analysis_options_test.yaml
```

Then you can see suggestions in your IDE or you can run checks manually:

```bash
dart analyze;
dart run custom_lint;
```
