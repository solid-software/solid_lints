# prefer_expression_function_bodies

State: **Disabled**.

Not used, as the default app template has a single statement return code generated.
While this could be beneficial for Dart projects and maintaining code style, we are unaware
of any substantial evidence that improves code when using expression function body
vs single statement return. We are considering including this in Dart only lints.
